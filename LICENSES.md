The Municipal Health Service (GGD GHOR) reserves all rights to the works that belong to the Municipal Health Service published on this GitHub account. Nevertheless, reuse is permitted under the following conditions.

First - The work that is created in the Covid19 context, such as the notification app, is available under the EUPL/1.2 license; and any outside contributions to it are under an individual Committer License Agreement (iCLA) that references this license explicitly.

However - that does not mean that all (derived) work is solely under that single license. For example - where appropriate certain (open source) modules may be required and included. These will remain under their original Copyright and License (though some may be released under the EUPL/1.2 if they are unsuitable to be contributed back upstream).
